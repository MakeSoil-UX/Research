	+ making it easy to know what matter a heap does and does not accept
	+ providing other instructions about how to make deposits to a particular heap
	+ broadcasting requests from Makers to Supporters ("Anyone have sawdust or leaves?" "More + coffee grounds please, they heat up the pile and smell nice!")
	+ And other tools to help communities to come together to create new, living soil.
+ Users?
	+ Soil Makers: who have mastered the alchemy of turning food scraps into living soil
	+ Soil Supporters: who bring their food scraps to nearby heaps
	+ Who these people could be? Professional or amateur?
	+
